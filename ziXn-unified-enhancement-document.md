## Phase 2 Development Tasks

### Multi-Tile Simulation Loop & Data Management

#### 1. Tile Activation & Deactivation Mechanism
**Objective:** Implement dynamic tile spawning/removal based on particle presence using a **TileSet** manager with spatial hash mapping.

**Algorithm:**
- Track active tile coordinates in spatial hash map for O(1) lookups
- Mark tiles as **required** based on particle spatial indices (`floor(position/tile_size)`)
- Allocate new tiles from pool when particles enter empty regions
- Schedule deactivation with hysteresis (frame delay/threshold) to prevent thrashing
- Use `zxCreateTilePool` for efficient tile index management

**Implementation Notes:**
- Maintains scene update loop with tile management module
- Prevents rapid toggle through cooldown periods
- Ghost tile removal for adaptive domain shrinking

#### 2. Neighbor List Construction & Ghost Region Updates
**Objective:** Maintain 26-neighbor connectivity in 3D with cross-tile interaction support.

**Algorithm:**
- Build neighbor lists during tile activation/deactivation events
- Implement ghost region handling via overlap layers or explicit boundary data exchange
- Perform deterministic tile boundary merges after P2G transfers
- Sum overlapping node contributions with canonical ordering (lowest tile ID wins)

**Ghost Exchange Process:**
- After local grid computation, copy border node data to neighbor ghost nodes
- Use synchronized/atomic operations for race-free updates
- Treat inactive neighbors as solid boundaries or ignore out-of-bounds

#### 3. Particle Migration Between Tiles
**Objective:** Seamless particle movement across tile boundaries during G2P updates.

**Algorithm:**
- Calculate new tile coordinate: `(floor(new_position/B))` where B is tile length
- Mark particles for transfer when tile coordinate changes  
- Remove from old tile list, add to new tile list (O(1) average with spatial hashing)
- Trigger tile activation if migrating to inactive region
- Handle multi-tile jumps in large timesteps through iterative migration

**Data Structure Requirements:**
- SoA particle layout (`zx_particle_soa`) supporting efficient removal/insertion
- Spatial hash or grid-to-tile lookup for new tile index resolution

#### 4. Deterministic Tile Merge Reduction
**Objective:** Combine overlapping tile border data in deterministic order to avoid floating-point nondeterminism.

**Strategies:**
- Assign canonical ordering to tiles (by ID/coordinates)
- Have lowest-ID tile perform sum for shared faces/edges
- Use warp-synchronous programming on GPU: threads collectively accumulate via shuffle operations before single write
- CPU implementation: single-threaded merge loop with fixed tile ordering

**Verification:**
- Run dual simulations with different thread counts/GPU execution orders
- Compute state checksums - identical checksums indicate correct deterministic merging

### GPU Pipeline Integration

#### 5. P2G Compute Shader Dispatch
**Objective:** Implement Particle-to-Grid transfer on GPU with minimal divergence and memory contention.

**Dispatch Strategy:**
- Launch one thread group per tile for cache locality
- Use shared memory for tile-local node accumulation (avoiding global atomics)
- Each thread loads one particle, computes 3×3×3 neighbor weights, scatters to shared memory
- Single thread writes final shared memory sum to global grid buffer

**Buffer Management:**
- Bind particle SoA buffers as SRV, grid buffers as UAV
- Zero grid buffers for new frame during tile activation
- Insert UAV barrier after P2G for memory coherence

#### 6. Constitutive & Internal Forces Kernel
**Objective:** GPU pass for material constitutive laws, internal forces, and grid physics updates.

**Core Operations:**

- Calculate strain rates from neighboring node velocities
- Apply constitutive models (Neo-Hookean, corotated linear elasticity)
- Perform plasticity return mapping (Mohr-Coulomb, Drucker-Prager yield criteria)
- Apply internal forces (`f_int = ∇·σ`) and external forces (gravity)

**Yield Processing:**
- Trial stress computation followed by yield criterion check
- Project stress back onto yield surface if criterion violated
- Preserve volume for incompressible plastic flows

#### 7. Contact Projection & Constraints (GPU)
**Objective:** Enforce contact constraints on grid nodes with frictional boundary conditions.

**Contact Algorithm:**
- Identify contact-active nodes using signed distance fields (SDF)
- Project node velocities: normal component ≥ 0, tangential within Coulomb friction cone
- For penetration velocity: clamp normal component to zero
- For tangential: limit to `|v_t| ≤ μ * v_n` where μ is friction coefficient

**Implementation:**
- One thread per grid node checking collider proximity
- Support ground plane and wheel/track contact geometries
- Update momentum accordingly: `p = m * v_projected`

#### 8. Optional Slurry Pressure Solve (PCG)
**Objective:** Iterative pressure solve for incompressible two-phase materials using Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient.

**Linear System Formation:**
- Identify fluid nodes, compute velocity field divergence

- Matrix A represents discrete Laplacian on fluid region

**PCG Implementation:**

- Pressure gradient application to velocity correction
- Typically 5-15 iterations for real-time constraints

#### 9. G2P Kernel & Particle Update
**Objective:** Grid-to-Particle transfer with APIC affine matrix updates and particle state evolution.

**Transfer Process:**
- Interpolate velocities: `v_p = Σ N_i * v_i` using shape function weights
- Update APIC matrix: `C_p = Σ N_i * (v_i - v_p) ⊗ (x_i - x_p)`
- Advance positions: `x_p = x_p + v_p * dt`
- Update deformation gradient: `F_p = (I + dt * ∇v_p) * F_p`

**Particle-Level Plasticity:**
- Apply return mapping to ensure stress remains on yield surface
- For snow: reduce F_p volume if exceeding compaction limits
- Clamp deformation gradients per material model requirements

#### 10. Terrain Writeback Encoding
**Objective:** Convert simulation results to engine-readable output layers (heightmaps, material masks).

**Output Layers:**
- **Heightfield Displacement:** Sample particle heights, subtract base terrain height
- **Compression/Wetness Mask:** Based on particle volume change (`J = det(F)`) or saturation
- **Contact Mask:** Mark areas where collider contact occurred

**Engine Integration:**
