This project is offered under a dual license. Your use is governed by ONE of the following licenses, based on your status and use case:

1) Community License (MIT) — for qualifying individuals and micro-entities  
   If you qualify under the criteria below, you may use the Software under the MIT terms contained in [LICENSE-OPEN-SOURCE.txt](LICENSE-OPEN-SOURCE.txt).

2) Commercial License — for businesses, studios, and organizations over the revenue threshold or any commercial use that does not qualify for the Community License  
   If you do not qualify for the Community License, you must obtain a Commercial License under the terms in [LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.txt](LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.txt).

Definitions

- "Software" means the ziXn source code and accompanying materials in this repository.  
- "Annual Gross Revenue" means your or your organization’s total revenue recognized in the preceding 12 months under applicable accounting standards, before expenses.  
- "Qualified Individual" means a natural person acting solely in their personal capacity, not on behalf of a company, and not receiving compensation for the use of the Software.  
- "Qualified Micro-entity" means an organization with less than USD $100,000 in Annual Gross Revenue, not part of a larger group that collectively exceeds the threshold.

License Selection

- You may use the Community License (MIT) only if:
  - You are a Qualified Individual using the Software for personal, non-commercial projects; or
  - You are a Qualified Micro-entity (Annual Gross Revenue < USD $100,000) using the Software and not re-licensing it as a competing library or service.

- You must use the Commercial License if:
  - Your organization’s Annual Gross Revenue is USD $100,000 or more; or
  - You are using the Software in any commercial product, service, or for-compensation activity and you do not qualify as a Qualified Individual or Qualified Micro-entity; or
  - You need rights that are not granted under the Community License (e.g., embedding in a proprietary SDK, sublicensing as a library, indemnity, support, SLAs).
